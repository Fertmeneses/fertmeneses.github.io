  <p>I'm a physicist with expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Sensing and Magnetic Nanomaterials. I've mainly worked at the <b>University of Melbourne</b> (Australia), the <b>City College of New York</b> (USA) and the <b>National University of CÃ³rdoba</b> (Argentina), where I'm currently employed as an associate professor. In the last years, I've been focusing on combining my Machine Learning skills with my background in experimental Physics and data science.</p>

## Artificial Intelligence assisting Quantum noise spectroscopy

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">
  <div style="flex: 2.5;">
    <p><b>Quantum diamond magnetometry</b>, a sensing technique based on atomic defects in a diamond lattice, is a powerful tool to the <b>magnetic environment</b> of a sample and extract information about the <b>noise spectral density</b>. </br>In this project, we have incorporated <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> methods to train a deep learning neural network, using a large dataset comprised of simulations, and predict the noise spectrum for experimental magnetic signals. Our novel work has demonstrated an <b>improved efficiency compared to traditional approaches</b>, achieving more accurate results.</p>
