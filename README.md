  <p>I'm a physicist with expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Sensing and Magnetic Nanomaterials. I've mainly worked at the <b>University of Melbourne</b> (Australia), the <b>City College of New York</b> (USA) and the <b>National University of C√≥rdoba</b> (Argentina), where I'm currently employed as an associate professor. In the last years, I've been focusing on combining my Machine Learning skills with my background in experimental Physics and data science.</p>

## Artificial Intelligence assisting Quantum Noise Spectroscopy

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">
  <div style="flex: 2.5;">
    <p><b>Quantum diamond magnetometry</b>, a sensing technique based on atomic defects in a diamond lattice, is a powerful tool to the <b>magnetic environment</b> of a sample and extract information about the <b>noise spectral density</b>. </br>In this project, we have incorporated <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> methods to train a deep learning neural network, using a large dataset comprised of simulations, and predict the noise spectrum for experimental magnetic signals. Our novel work has demonstrated an <b>improved efficiency compared to traditional approaches</b>, achieving more accurate results.</p>

    <p>This project is based on the famous Kaggle competition, in which a Machine Learning algorithm must be designed to predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy, based on a small and incomplete dataset. I've made a deep study for this challenge, exploring many <b>feature engineering</b> possibilities and <b>AI architectures</b>. My results are above the mean performance, although there is much room for improvement, and that's why I've documented my code and reasoning in a clear way and invite the readers to contribute with comments and suggestions.</p>

## Spaceship Titanic: AI to the rescue

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">
  <div style="flex: 2.5;">
    <p>In this Kaggle competition, in the year 2912 the Titanic Spaceship was launched, and it met a similar fate as its old predecesor in a galaxy tragedy that sent half of the passengers to an alternative dimension. There's still time to rescue them, but we must first identify these passengers from a scarce information. In this project, the goal is to use <b>Data Analysis and Machine Learning skills</b> to predict which passengers where transported to the alternative dimensions.</p>

While I'm working in the full solution, I've segmented my work in progressive stages, starting with data analysis and continuing with the Machine Learning implementation. You can check the first two chapters, already published in Kaggle:
